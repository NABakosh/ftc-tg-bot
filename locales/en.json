		"Tips from Us": "1. Start with a 3D model of the robot 🖥️: Before starting the assembly, it is important to create a 3D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) model of the robot. This will help visualize how all the parts will work together and avoid mistakes during assembly. Using tools like Tinkercad or Fusion 360 allows for more precise design and ensures all components fit together perfectly.\n\n2. Plan rest and recovery in advance 🧘: Planning for rest is key to productivity. Make sure to schedule time for recovery and relaxation in advance. Proper rest helps maintain clear thinking and energy for tackling complex tasks. This way, you'll stay calm and ready for new achievements.\n\n3. Use engineering holes to reduce weight ⚙️: When designing parts for the robot, adding holes in areas where they don't affect strength can help reduce the overall weight of the structure. This is especially important for robots where weight plays a role in maneuverability and efficiency. Be sure to consider where you can add holes to reduce weight without weakening the structure.",
